### Capturing the Mood, Combining the Elements

FLOR’s signature photography style reflects both environmental responsibility and design sensibility. Photos feel personal and inviting, with allusions to FLOR’s focus on design as a lived experience. This is achieved through subtle desaturation, slightly less contrast, softer blacks, and an overall warm tone meant to mimic uncoated, off-white, natural paper stock. 

Brand photography fits into one of four categories; photos from each work together as “swatches” that belong to a larger design process and story.
