The primary type in the FLOR system, Worchester EF is friendly by design. A humanist type, it is highly readable and approachable, balancing warmth and easy confidence with a sense of play. At large sizes, in Demi-Bold weight, it commands attention and interest. As body copy, it remains legible and user-friendly. It comes in a variety of bold weights, and along with italics, can be used for emphasis.
