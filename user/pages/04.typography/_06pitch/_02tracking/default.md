All Pitch paragraph styles have specific tracking. Diagrammatic styles are tracked to 25. Manually adjusting tracking for specific lines of type is allowable in order to prevent orphans and widows or to smooth out diagrammatical notes — this adjustment shouldn’t extend past 10 above or 10 below original setting.
