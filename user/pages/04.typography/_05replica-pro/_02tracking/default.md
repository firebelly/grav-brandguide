All Replica Pro paragraph styles have specific tracking. Inline Titles are tracked to 150, Body is tracked to 15 and Details are tracked to 25. Manually adjusting tracking for specific lines of type is allowable in order to prevent orphans and widows or to smooth out paragraph rags — this adjustment shouldn’t extend past 10 above or 10 below original setting.
