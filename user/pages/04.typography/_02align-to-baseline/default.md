All hand-held sized print materials are built on a 6pt baseline grid which helps to create consistent alignments throughout the system. The leading (line-height) of all character styles should be divisible by 6pt. All type should be set to align to baseline. This can be done through Paragraph Style Options > Indents and Spacing > Align to Grid or the bottom right of the Paragraph palette.
