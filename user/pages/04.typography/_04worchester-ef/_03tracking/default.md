All Worchester EF paragraph styles have specific tracking. H1 is tracked to 10. H2, Product Names and Pull Quotes are all tracked to 20. Body is tracked to 25. Manually adjusting tracking for specific lines of type is allowable in order to prevent orphans and widows or to smooth out paragraph rags — this adjustment shouldn’t extend past 10 above or 10 below original setting.
