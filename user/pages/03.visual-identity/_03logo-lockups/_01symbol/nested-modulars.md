Primary lockup with registered trademark symbol is vertical with horizontal being a second choice. The horizontal lockup works when a large amount of space needs to be filled.

The registered trademark symbol should always accompany each lockup of the FLOR logo sets. Its small size is responding to spacing within the design grid.
