Primary lockup with “An Interface Company” is vertical with horizontal being a second choice. The horizontal lockup works when a large amount of space needs to be filled.

“An Interface Company” is always aligned to the bottom left of the grid module it occupies. It can break away from the lockup — moving modularly along the grid to create interest and play within layouts. “An Interface Company” shouldn’t be typed out using Worchester as the letterforms have been customized and spacing has been refined. Interface should always be set using the Interface logotype. When “An Interface Company” lives separately from the FLOR logotype, it can use a single line layout.
