Primary lockup with the FLOR tagline is vertical with horizontal being a second choice. The horizontal lockup works when a large amount of space needs to be filled.

The FLOR tagline is always aligned to the bottom left of the grid module it occupies. The stacked layout should always be used for the tagline. The tagline can break away from the lockup — moving modularly along the grid to create interest and play within layouts. The FLOR tagline shouldn’t be typed out using Worchester as the letterforms have been customized and spacing has been refined.
