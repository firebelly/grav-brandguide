## Made to move

The FLOR visual identity brings the brandâ€™s value + philosophy to life. Focused on movement and creativity, the identity system builds in flexibility for mutable messaging and styles, demonstrating infinite design possibilities within a supportive, principled framework. 

The visual brand is playful and confident. It conveys simplicity and invites interaction. It is the design experience, made visual.
