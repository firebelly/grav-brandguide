The scattered approach of the secondary style fits nicely into a 2x3 and 3x2 scenario. It’s meant for in-store and box cover situations. In-store, it will most often be used for larger concept words like “design” or “sustainable.” The box would utilize a 2x3 or 3x2 “FLOR.” logotype.

The scattered lockups are meant to reflect the in-store design process and options of designing a rug. Moments where creation and assembly of squares is happening would be where this lockup is executed. This can include web interfaces of the FLORbuilder loading animation.
