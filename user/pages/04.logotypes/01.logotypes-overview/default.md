Primary lockup is vertical with horizontal being a second choice. Vertical most often fits easier at eye level on a streetscape for signage. The horizontal lockup works when a large amount 
of wide facade space needs to be filled.

The goal is maximum understanding and readability of the FLOR logo with most effective orientation based on unique space consideration. Store presence and recognition should be well understood.
