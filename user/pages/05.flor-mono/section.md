### Built from the square
The FLOR type system uses a custom-designed display font called “FLOR Mono,” which appears as the logotype. It is built from the square, the key element to FLOR’s creative rug design process.

Each letter fits snugly into a structured, staggered grid, as seen in FLOR logo variations and accent words.
