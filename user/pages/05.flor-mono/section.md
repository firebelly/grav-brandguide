### Built from the square
The FLOR type system is built around a custom-designed display font called “FLOR Mono,” which appears in the logo. It is built from the square, the key element to FLOR’s creative rug design process.

Each letter fits snugly into a structured, staggered grid, as seen in FLOR logo variations and accent words.
