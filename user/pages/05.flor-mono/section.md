### Built from the square
Typography plays an important role in establishing the tone of FLOR’s brand expression. The FLOR system uses a new, custom-designed display font called “FLOR Mono” that will be used for logo and messaging across all media. It is built from the square, our key piece of creative rug design. Each letter fits tightly in a struc- tured grid forming large words, including the FLOR logo variations.
