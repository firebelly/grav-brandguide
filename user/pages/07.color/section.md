## Undertones of<br> Nature and Design

FLOR’s brand colors are intentionally diverse, organized around two core palettes: Natural and Design. Together, they reflect the brand’s values and focus on sustainability and humanity throughout the design process. 

Natural undertones are cool greys; Design undertones are warm. Each palette includes accent colors that can be used interchangeably to highlight the connection between nature and design.
