Consumer-facing print collateral and product packaging feature the FLOR logo and tagline lock-up. Introductory-level materials and creation tools (e.g., sketchbooks, Open Me First box) include the core brand yellow. Pieces shared at a deeper point of interaction (e.g., business cards, thank you cards) pull from Design and Nature undertones.
