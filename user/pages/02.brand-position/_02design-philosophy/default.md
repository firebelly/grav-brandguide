### Good design is intentional,
and requires time, energy and communication. It values humanity, embodies a clear vision for the future, and it builds in room for growth. 

### good design distills complex thoughts
into simple, honest expressions. It transforms powerful ideas into objects and experiences that can be seen, felt, remembered and shared.

### good design is the foundation for a beautiful life,
a beautiful home and a beautiful planet. In a well-design system, nothing goes to waste. No materials are used that cannot be replaced. Each piece works in harmony with all others—it serves a purpose and can be repurposed to maintain the system’s beauty and integrity.
