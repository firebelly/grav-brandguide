### Our voice is an extension of our brand. 

Like our logotype, it should be distinctive, balancing a sense of play with cool confidence. We are friendly and honest, preferring simplicity to verbosity. We don’t often need to repeat ourselves. 

### Our tone shifts according to context.

Catalog stories can be both informative *and* colorful—feel free to let our personality shine through. Clever wordplay is acceptable, but let’s avoid cheesy puns. Assembly instructions, on the other hand, should be concise and easy to understand.

### Our goal is to inspire positive action. 

Use inclusive, 1st person pronouns (we, our, us) and direct address (you) to help build confidence and trust while empowering fans to take an active role in their design experience. We want them to feel confident in their creative abilities, proud of their purchase decisions, and excited to share their designs.
